Super cstom scripts made by Gaby  on May 07 2012 to 'automatize' photos gallery generation

It's a quick and dirty script in bash, but does quickly what I want to achieve
It requires convert (from ImageMagick), and ffmepg2theora programs

The better is to create one folder with the date name to have a sorted list. A description file can be append if it respects the convention "folder name".desc

Convention from $folder:
    $folder.desc => provide quick desc in html file
    $folder.pictures.tar => link pictures to html file
    $folder.videos.tar => link videos to html file

Conventin other:
    links.external => each line is a link which is append end of file
    title => is the title of HTML landing page
    ga.js => script to have google analytics script incorporated

Supported files (case sensitive :S):
    *.jpg
    *.JPG
    *.MOV

== Installation ==

On the gallery you want to expose:
    * git init if it's not already a git repo
    * git remote add origin git://github.com/eirmag/bash-gallery.git
    * git pull origin master 
    * you can now run the script

Prior to install, modify the important elements:

If you have a google analytics account, change your id and domain name in ga.js
If you want to list external links (raw display) related to the gallery being generatd, put them in links.external 
If you want to modify title, modify title file :)

Several informations are directly generated by the script file. For instance, the header and footer elements can be changed directly in this 

== Run ==

To run the script, simply type:
    $ make generate
or
    $ ./generate_th_html.sh
